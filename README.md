# Mask Detector

# Disclaimer
Utilizes a modified version of Adrian Rosebrock's code from [COVID-19: Face Mask Detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/) to familiarize myself with machine learning practices in a fun little project.
