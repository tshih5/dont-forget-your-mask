# Mask Detector

## Disclaimer
Utilizes a modified version of Adrian Rosebrock's code from [COVID-19: Face Mask Detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/) to familiarize myself with machine learning practices in a fun little project.

## Requirements
* python 3.7
* tensorflow (`pip install tensorflow`)
* NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
* scikit-learn (`pip install scikit-learn`)
* imutils (`pip install imutils`)
* MatplotLib (`pip install matplotlib`)
* openCV (`pip install opencv-contrib-python`)
* Twilio(`pip install twilio`)
* A Twilio account
* If on Windows, python-dotenv(`pip install python-dotenv`)

## Dataset
I used a subset of the [Real World Masked Face (RFMD)](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset) data set aggregated with the without_mask portion of Prajna Bhandary's [data set](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data) to train my model.
