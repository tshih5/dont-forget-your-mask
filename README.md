# Mask Detector

## Disclaimer
Utilizes a modified version of Adrian Rosebrock's code from [COVID-19: Face Mask Detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/) to familiarize myself with machine learning practices in a fun little project.

## Dataset
I used a subset of the [Real World Masked Face (RFMD)](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset) data set aggregated with the without_mask portion of Prajna Bhandary's [data set](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data) to train my model.
